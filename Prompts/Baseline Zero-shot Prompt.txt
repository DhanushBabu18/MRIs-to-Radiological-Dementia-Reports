prompt=f"""A {age}-year-old {sex} patient underwent structural MRI.
Here are the W-scores for selected brain regions:

Volumetry W-scores:
{Regions}-{W-scores}

Relevance W-scores:
{Regions}-{W-scores}

Cortical Thickness W-scores:
{Regions}-{W-scores}

Instructions:
Summarize only those brain regions that show significant deviation (i.e., w-scores outside the normal range).
For each region, write a line in this style:
Mild pathology in atrophied Left Temporal Lobe (volume w-score: , relevance w-score: )
Use 'atrophied' if the volume is negative, 'enlarged' if the volume is positive.
The severity is 'Mild' if the average absolute w-score is >2, 'Moderate' if >3, and 'Strong' if >4.
Important: When deciding which regions to summarize, consult the file titled Brain_Region_Parent_Child_Mapping' in the document database.
DO NOT include child regions if their parent region is already listed as pathological according to the relationships defined in that file.
Output one line per region. If there are no pathologic regions, write: 'No regions show significant pathology'.
Do NOT provide any diagnosis or extra commentaryâ€”just the list.
